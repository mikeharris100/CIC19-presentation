Paired Comparisons
    paired comparisons have become de facto for observer preference
    estimate time to set up / num participants
    How many of you have performed a paired comparison experiment?
    How many of those were satisfied with the numbers of participants?

To The Cloud!
    So, what can we get from the web?
    Lots of observers (hopefully)
    But...
        No control over viewing conditions
            Hopefully lots of different viewing conditions will 'come out in the wash'
            Maybe no control is a good thing? - real-world data

Web-Based Research Success Stories
    Moroney's colour naming experiment

The Reference Experiment

IQRI
    odd scale
    division by zero
    designed for unbalanced

Our Experiment
    controlled environment
    setup to ISO standard
    same images
    observers were from other departments at university (and were naive to the purpose)

Results

Results

Discussion - Flickr search for "HDR"

Discussion - Perceptible TMO differences

Discussion - The reference experiment
    Only a few observers
        Easy to cheat
            The authors probably (inadvertently) cheated quite a bit - they probably account for quite a few of the comparisons
            ... and me

Limitations of the Web
    Uncalibrated conditions
    ICC profiles - this experiment did not use, but others might
    f.lux et al.
    screen resolutions

Wait, What About...
    Maybe no control is a good thing?
    Me, just a minute ago

In Conclusion
    Moving your lab-based paired comparison experiment onto the web is not a "fire and forget" exercise
    I think you'll find it's a bit more complicated than that.

Other Possibilities
    Are other experiments better than TMOs? C2G?
